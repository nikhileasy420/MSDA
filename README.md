#Welcome to the world of Nikhil's Data Adventures! 

This github repository contains the Projects I worked on as part of My Graduate studies at SJSU in Data Analytics. 
The projects I worked on include: 

1. Urban Audio Classification using UrbanSound8k, ESC-50 audio datasets, by utilizing Vision transformers, with Transfer Learning, and a comparitive analysis against the CNN variants (CNN, CNN + LSTM, 2D-CNN). Data Augmentation was also involved, utilized SpecAugment, and some other Noise inducing augmentation techniques to help the models generalize better on unseen data. Achieved SOTA scores wrt Classification performance metrics -  Accuracy, precision, f1, AUC ROC, & recall - The brief report here https://shorturl.at/yFMP6

2. Predicting Side-effects from Drug-Drug Interactions using BioSNAP datasets, and Graph modeling. Modeled the drug-drug interactions to predict the possibility of a side-effect for a certain dr-dr reaction. This has high real time relevance as Polypharmacy is one of the key current areas of research. Utilized Neo4j to model the graphs, Utilized Jaccard distances to understand the distribution of nodes & edges in the network, Word2Vec for feature engineering, utilized standard ML algorithms like Decision tree, Logistic regression, but the performance metrics were too low. Utilized GCN to result in accuracy of 87%, along with significant improvement in other metrics - The brief report & code base here - https://shorturl.at/lwP45
