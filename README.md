# Exploring BART, VTA Transportation data models by implementing them through BigQuery, and answering some interesting analytics questions through Neo4j, and MongoDB
Course related submissions

This repository contains all the working files of our DB for Analytics Course Project. We have tried to explore the BART data model, and VTA data model, by creating 
ER Diagrams using their respective GTFS Datasets, which are present in DBMSDA/DB-course-project/RDBMS/DBMS Course Project/.

The files for bart and VTA are differentiated through the suffix of the files. We have also added the relevant ER - Diagrams for both the data models. 

Additional to this data modelling, we also tried to analyze the ridership data of BART frmo 2018, to currently across different dimensions, we have also included
these notebooks in DBMSDA/DB-course-project/RDBMS/DBMS Course Project/MongoDB 

We have also tried to use Neo4j, to answer some shortest path algorithms, and answer some interesting questions related to the path, and cost.
